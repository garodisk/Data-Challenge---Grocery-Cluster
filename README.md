Data Challenge - Identifying Grocery Clusters
Company XYZ is an online grocery store. In the current version of the website, they have manually grouped the items into a few categories based on their experience.

However, they now have a lot of data about user purchase history. Therefore, they would like to put the data into use! This is what they asked you to do:

The company founder wants to meet with some of the best customers to go through a focus group with them. You are asked to send the ID of the following customers to the founder:

1) The customer who bought the most items overall in her lifetime.

2) For each item, the customer who bought that product the most.

3) Cluster items based on user co-purchase history.

That is, create clusters of products that have the highest probability of being bought together.

The goal of this is to replace the old/manually created categories with these new ones. Each item can belong to just one cluster.
